So here we discuss Avg CPC[cost per click] and Avg CTR[click-through rate] Vs Campaign

In this bar graph, we can see that campaign 3 has the highest Cost per click and low Click through rate 

After analyzing all the given data.

hence in comparison campaign 3 has low-cost efficiency and maximum attention


next slide plz


By coming to Geography Vs CPR


Here we are plotting a geography graph across different countries

where different color shows different countries and groups						

as we can see AUS has the highest CPR (cost per result)

so Camping 3 AUS and UK are the least cost efficient and it must be dropped. 

Next slides would be presented my team
